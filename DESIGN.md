# Fitness Dashboard UI Prompt (Tailwind-Ready, Blue Operator)

## Master Prompt (paste into your AI coding agent)

Build a **professional fitness analytics dashboard** with a **serious operator** / **enterprise sport-science** aesthetic (think Datadog/Stripe-style analytics). It should feel like an internal performance tool for a data-driven athlete/coach — **not** a very consumer-oriented fitness app.

### Visual Style
- **Light-first**, premium, restrained, engineered
- **Balanced density** (powerful but uncluttered)
- **Sharp hierarchy**: big KPIs → time-series charts → detail tables
- **Modern sans** typography, high readability, precise numbers
- Minimal ornamentation: **dividers > borders**, subtle elevation, no gimmicks

### Blue Color System (use sparingly)
- Background: `#F5F7FA`
- Surface (cards): `#FFFFFF`
- Divider/border: `#E6EAF0`
- Text primary: `#0F172A`
- Text secondary: `#475569`
- **Accent primary (deep blue): `#1E3A8A`**
- Accent interactive: `#2563EB`
- Accent highlight (fills): `#DBEAFE`

**Rule:** Blue is for emphasis/active states/key metrics only — never decorative.

### Layout
- 12-column responsive grid
- Top: KPI summary row
- Middle: time-series panels
- Bottom: tables (sessions/sets/metrics)
- Optimized for scanning in < 3 seconds

### Motion
Subtle only:
- KPI count-up on load
- Chart draw-in (left→right)
- Card hover elevation + soft shadow transition
No glow, bounce, parallax, or gamification.

### Adjectives
**Sharp, premium, clean, athletic, sleek, data-driven.**
